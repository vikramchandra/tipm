# Amazon Says My Original Book is "Stolen"  -  How to Fight a False Copyright Claim

You open your email and your stomach drops.

"Your KDP account has been terminated."

The email is vague - something about "content that infringes copyright" or "does not comply with our guidelines." No specifics. No human to call. Just your entire publishing business - years of writing, thousands in royalties - gone in an instant.

You didn't steal anything. You wrote every word. You paid for your cover, your editing, your ISBN. And now you're being treated like a criminal by a system that won't even tell you what you allegedly did wrong.

Your friends and family don't understand. "Just call Amazon," they say. As if there's a number. As if anyone would answer.

If you're reading this in that moment of panic and rage, here's what you need to know: you're not crazy, you're not alone, and there *is* a way to fight back. But first, you need to understand what you're up against.

## Why This Happens

Amazon's copyright enforcement system follows a simple - and brutal - logic: anyone can file a claim against any book, and Amazon will remove it immediately. No verification. No investigation. Your book vanishes first; questions come later (if at all).

One author who went through this nightmare put it bluntly: "KDP heavily uses bots and algorithms to screen published work. The bots are notorious for over-accusation, hence get things wrong quite frequently. But that's not KDP's problem. The burden of proof is on the authors."

Here's what triggers these false claims:

**Competitor sabotage.** Yes, really. Competitors file fake infringement claims to knock successful books off the market. Dave Chesson, founder of [Kindlepreneur](https://kindlepreneur.com/how-to-fight-copyright-infringement/), had his account frozen when a rival filed a completely fabricated claim. His $1,600/month income stream? Disrupted until he hired a lawyer.

**AI-generated duplicates.** Scammers use AI to publish fake books under real authors' names. [Jane Friedman](https://janefriedman.com/i-would-rather-see-my-books-pirated/), a respected publishing industry expert, found AI-generated titles listed under her name on Amazon. When she tried to report them through normal channels, Amazon asked for trademark registration numbers - and closed her case when she couldn't provide them. The [Authors Guild reports](https://authorsguild.org/news/ai-driving-new-surge-of-sham-books-on-amazon/) this problem is accelerating rapidly.

**Amazon's own bots.** You updated your cover? Changed a keyword? Republished a revised edition? Congratulations - you may have just triggered Amazon's algorithms. Author Kat Ross had her book *The Midnight Sea* yanked after changing a single keyword, even though she'd sold foreign and audio rights and held the ISBNs. "Just to show how arbitrary this is," she wrote, "they're not questioning any other book in the same series."

**Pen name confusion.** If the name on your copyright documents doesn't exactly match your author name, Amazon's system may flag you as a fraud - even if you can prove they're the same person.

## What Amazon's Process Actually Looks Like

Here's the part that makes authors want to scream into the void.

Every email you receive comes from a different agent somewhere around the world. This is by design - Amazon intentionally distributes support globally and gives reps extremely limited scripts. They can't deviate, can't elaborate, and often can't actually help.

The accusations are deliberately vague. You won't be told *what* specifically is infringing or *who* made the claim. You'll get template language that could apply to anything.

You have five business days to respond. But resolving the issue? That can take weeks or months.

And here's the cruelest twist: trying to fix things can make them worse. One author described "the correction trap" - attempting to resolve one accusation only to trigger additional flags from different departments.

As that same author discovered: "Because KDP still held distribution rights to the book, even though they would not sell it on Amazon, I would not be able to take my manuscript to another distributor. My book was held hostage in Amazon KDP forever."

## How to Fight Back

Enough about the problem. Here's what actually works.

### The First 48 Hours

**Don't panic. Don't send multiple appeals.** Flooding Amazon with messages flags you as problematic and slows resolution.

**Gather your evidence immediately:**
- Copyright registration certificate (if you have one)
- Screenshots of your ISBN account showing you as owner
- Invoices from your editor, cover designer, formatter
- Original manuscript files with creation dates
- Any contracts or rights reversion letters

**Respond within the five-day deadline.** Even if you don't have everything ready, acknowledge receipt and explain documentation is coming.

### Craft Your Appeal

Be professional, factual, and specific. No emotional rants - they don't help.

Treat Amazon's requirements as a checklist. If they ask for A, B, and C, provide exactly those items. Create a formal PDF on letterhead if you can. Include digital signatures where possible.

**What carries weight:**
- Approved copyright registration from [copyright.gov](https://www.copyright.gov/) (not just the application)
- Screenshots of your [Bowker ISBN account](https://www.myidentifiers.com/) showing your name as owner
- Distributor documentation from IngramSpark or Draft2Digital

**What doesn't work:**
- The copyright page in your book (Amazon explicitly says this is not sufficient)
- Personal statements of ownership
- Unsigned contracts

### The Escalation Ladder

If your initial appeal fails, escalate in this order:

1. **Request phone contact.** Go to Author Central > Contact Us and ask to speak with someone. A live human can sometimes cut through the bureaucracy.

2. **Contact the Authors Guild.** If you're a member, reach out to staff@authorsguild.org. They have direct lines to Amazon and have cleared cases in under 24 hours.

3. **Get an attorney to send a demand letter.** This works remarkably well. One author got his account reinstated after his lawyer sent letters to KDP's legal department. Total cost? $5.75 for postage. (He used [LegalShield](https://www.legalshield.com/), a subscription service that provides attorney access.) [AMZ Sellers Attorney](https://www.amazonsellers.attorney/kdp-acx-suspensions.html) also specializes in KDP suspensions.

4. **Go public.** Social media pressure has resolved cases when official channels failed. Author Lexi Ostrow got her account restored in eight days after taking her story public. An Amazon executive later admitted there was "no suspicious content" in her book.

### What Absolutely Doesn't Work

**Sending multiple appeals.** It hurts you.

**Emailing Jeff Bezos.** One author tried this "almost daily." Not a single response.

**Republishing the blocked book with minor changes.** This can get your account permanently terminated. As one author community warned: "Don't ever try to get around a blocked/banned book by changing something slightly and republishing it. They lost their accounts."

**Signing a "sworn statement of guilt" when you're innocent.** Amazon sometimes pressures authors to admit wrongdoing. Resist. It can hurt you if you need legal recourse later.

**Contacting KDP executives on LinkedIn.** Letters come back unopened.

## Armor Up for Next Time

If you survive this nightmare - or if you're reading this *before* disaster strikes - here's how to protect yourself.

**Register your copyright.** $45-65 at [copyright.gov](https://www.copyright.gov/) gives you legal standing to sue and access to the [Copyright Claims Board](https://ccb.gov/) (a small-claims option for disputes under $30,000).

**Own your ISBN.** $125 for one or $295 for ten from [Bowker](https://www.myidentifiers.com/). This establishes you as the official publisher of record with documentation Amazon can't dispute.

**Keep everything.** Contracts, emails, invoices, early drafts with timestamps, dashboard screenshots. If you ever need to prove ownership, paperwork wins.

**Don't publish exclusively on Amazon.** Use IngramSpark, Draft2Digital, Kobo, Apple Books. If Amazon nukes your account, you'll still have income.

**The IngramSpark workaround.** Here's something most authors don't know: if you publish through IngramSpark, your book appears on Amazon - but bypasses KDP's bot system entirely. As one author who went through termination put it: "My book will appear on the Amazon website. The difference is, this time no Amazon bots or algorithms can touch it."

**Set up Google Alerts** for your name and book titles. Catch AI fakes and scam listings early.

**Join author organizations.** The [Authors Guild](https://authorsguild.org/) and [Alliance of Independent Authors](https://selfpublishingadvice.org/) (ALLi) can intervene when individual appeals fail.

## You're Not Alone

Authors have won these fights. One was reinstated after being offline for 14 months. Another went through a six-month legal battle - and came out victorious. Some resolved everything in days once the right people got involved.

The system is rigged against you. Amazon built automated enforcement for efficiency, not justice. But authors who document everything, escalate strategically, and don't give up *do* get their accounts back.

You didn't steal anything. You wrote your book. And you have every right to fight for it.
